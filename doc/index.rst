#################################
Welcome to Nemoh's documentation!
#################################

NEMOH is a Boundary Element Methods (BEM) code dedicated to the computation of wave loads on offshore structures (added mass, radiation damping, diffraction forces, etc.). It has been developed by researchers at Ecole Centrale de Nantes for 30 years. Since its first release in January 2014, NEMOH, as the worldâ€™s first open-source BEM code, has been widely used by many researchers, and engineers. Typical use is the estimation of the dynamic response of floating structures or performance assessment of wave energy converters.

Now together with this manual, we gladly release NEMOH v3.0 which includes all recent developments in the first-order module and a new extension module for computing quadratic transfer functions (QTFs). This release will be, to our knowledge, the sole and only open-source BEM software that provides the second-order module.

We sincerely hope that the use of this software, just as the design of it has been, will be fascinating, and challenging for academicians and practitioners in the ocean engineering community. We hope to receive comments and suggestions for further improvement and extension of the software that can be profitable for the community.
