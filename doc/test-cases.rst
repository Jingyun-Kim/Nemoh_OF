Full description of the QTF test-cases results is reported in :cite:t:`Kurnia22_JH,Kurnia22`. Note that the QTF comparisons between NEMOH and HYDROSTAR for the bidirectional case are in good agreement only if the direction is switched, in NEMOH :math:`\beta=(\beta_1,\beta_2)` and in Hydrostar :math:`\beta=(\beta_2,\beta_1)`; further investigation regarding this is needed. The imaginary part of QTFs have also a difference sign between NEMOH and HYDROSTAR that may be due to different conventions of the incident potential.
