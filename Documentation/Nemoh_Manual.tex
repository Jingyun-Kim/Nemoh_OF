\title{NEMOH v3.0\\
User Manual}
\author{R. Kurnia and G. Ducrozet}
\maketitle

\section*{Preamble}
NEMOH is a Boundary Element Methods (BEM) code dedicated to the computation of wave loads on offshore structures (added mass, radiation damping, diffraction forces, etc.). It has been developed by researchers at Ecole Centrale de Nantes for 30 years. Since its first release in January 2014, NEMOH, as the world's first open-source BEM code, has been widely used by many researchers, and engineers. Typical use is the estimation of the dynamic response of floating structures or performance assessment of wave energy converters.

Now together with this manual, we gladly release NEMOH v3.0 which includes all recent developments in the first-order module and a new extension module for computing quadratic transfer functions (QTFs). This release will be, to our knowledge, the sole and only open-source BEM software that provides the second-order module.

We sincerely hope that the use of this software, just as the design of it has been, will be fascinating, and challenging for academicians and practitioners in the ocean engineering community. We hope to receive comments and suggestions for further improvement and extension of the software that can be profitable for the community.

\section{Description of NEMOH v3.0}\label{Sec:Descrip_NEMOH}
\subsection{Modelling and Numerical aspects}
This section provides background information on NEMOH v3.0 with a focus on basic scientific ideas.

NEMOH v3.0 contains two main modules. First, NEMOH1 solves linear diffraction and radiation problems of wave-structure interaction using a 3-D boundary element method in the frequency domain. Second, NEMOH2, an extended module for computing difference- and sum- frequencies Quadratic Transfer Functions (QTFs) for fixed or floating structures.\\

The following subsections describe the underlying modelling and numerical approaches used in NEMOH.

\subsubsection*{Notations}
As sketched in Fig. \ref{fig:sketch}, we consider fluid domain in the Cartesian coordinate $\bs x=(\vec{x},z)$ with $\vec{x}=(x,y)$ the horizontal coordinates perpendicular to the $z$ axis in the opposite direction of gravity $\bs g$. Free-surface boundary $S_F$ is defined by the free surface elevation at time $t$, denoted as $\eta(\vec{x},t)$ with respect to the mean water level at $z=0$. The fluid velocity potential is denoted as $\Phi(\bs x,t)$ with $\bs x$ in fluid domain $V_{\Omega}$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7,trim = 0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm, clip]{figures/Sketch.png}
\caption{Sketch definition of the system}\label{fig:sketch}
\end{figure}

The floating body has 6 degrees of freedom (DoF), $\bs\xi=(\bs{X},\bs{\theta})$ where the positions, $\bs{X}=(X,Y,Z)$ and the orientations, $\bs{\theta}=(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$ are determined at the center of gravity (COG). Displacements of points at the hull are specified by a body of vector $\bs r$ with respect to the COG as $\bs{\mathcal{X}}=\bs{X}+R(\bs{r})$. $R$ is a rotation operator where $R(\bs r)\approx \bs \theta \times \bs r$. The velocity of the points at the hull is expressed as $\dot{\bs{\mathcal{X}}}$.

On the body hull $S_B$, the wetted part is defined as a function $z=\zeta(\vec{x},t)$. The normalized normal vector is defined as directed toward the fluid domain,  $\bs n=-\bs N/|\bs N|$ with $\bs N=\left(-\nabla_2\zeta,1 \right)$ where $\nabla_2$ is the two-dimensional gradient in $\vec{x}$. Then the six-dimensional generalized normal vector is defined as $\bs \nu=(\bs n,\bs r \times \bs n)^T$, with $( )^T$ the matrix transpose operator.

\subsubsection*{Modelling}
NEMOH1, the first-order solver, is based on the following modelling principles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Potential flow theory for an inviscid and incompressible fluid in irrotational motion. The set of equations solved looks for unknowns satisfying free-surface conditions, impermeable bottom condition, diffraction and radiation conditions on the body hull and radiation wave condition in the far field.
\item The harmonic fluid potential is defined as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:PhiHarm}
\Phi(\bs x,t)=Re\left\lbrace\Phi^{(1)}(\bs x)e^{-i\omega t}\right\rbrace.
\end{align}
The total potential, $\Phi$, is the sum of the incident potential, the diffraction potential and the radiation potential.
The incident potential is defined as, with $k$ and $\omega$ related with the dispersion relation, $\vec{k}=k(\cos \beta,\sin \beta)$, $\beta$ is wave direction and $a$ is a unit wave amplitude,
\begin{align}\label{Eq:PhiI}
\Phi_{I}^{(1)}(\bs x)=-i\frac{a g}{\omega}\frac{\cosh(k(D+z))}{\cosh(kD)} e^{i\vec{k}\cdot \vec{x}}.
\end{align}
The radiation potential is defined as $\Phi_R(\bs x,t)=Re\left\lbrace \dot{\bs \xi}^{(1)}(t) \cdot \bs \psi(x)\right\rbrace$ where $\bs \psi(\bs x)$ is the normalized vector radiation potential.

\item The three-dimensional linear potential flow problem around arbitrary body condition is reformulated in the Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) and transformed into the two-dimensional problem of the source distribution, $\sigma$, on the body surface, $S_B$, using Green's second identity and the appropriate Green function, $G(\bs x,\bs x')$.
\item The Green function is based on Delhommeau's formulation and is available for finite and infinite water-depth, see \cite{Delhommeau}.
\item The source distribution depends on the considered boundary condition problem. For each frequency and wave direction, the diffraction source distribution, $\sigma_D(\bs x)$, depends on the position of the panels while the radiation source distribution, $\sigma_{R_j}(\bs x)$,  depends on the position of the panels and the considered degree of freedom $j$.

\item Then, the BIE for $\bs x \in S_B$, is expressed as, with flow points $\bs x$ and source points $\bs x'$,
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{D,R_j}(\bs x)-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{S_B} \partial_n G(\bs x, \bs x') \sigma_{D,R_j}(\bs x') dS'=\mathcal{N}_{D,R_j}(\bs x). \label{Eq:BIE_source_distribution}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{N}(\bs x)$ is the body normal condition. The diffraction normal condition is defined as $\mathcal{N}_D (\bs x)=-\partial_{n} \Phi_I^{(1)}(\bs x)$, the normalized radiation condition, $\mathcal{N}_R (\bs x)=\partial_{n} \Phi_{R_j}(\bs x)$, with $\Phi_{R_j}(\bs x)$ is the vector component-$j$ of the normalized radiation potential $\bs \psi(\bs x)$, explicitly $\bs \psi=(\Phi_{R_1},\Phi_{R_2},\cdots,\Phi_{R_{Ndof}})$.

\item The diffraction potential, $\Phi^{(1)}_{D}$, the normalized radiation  potential vector component-$j$, $\Phi_{R_j}$ and the corresponding velocities are then computed as follows, for the flow points in the fluid domain $\bs x \in S_B \cup V_{\Omega_F}$,
\begin{align} \label{Eq:BIE_Sol_Pot_Sb}
\Phi^{(1)}_{D,R_j}(\bs x)=&-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{S_B} G(\bs x, \bs x') \sigma_{D,R_j}(\bs x') dS'\\
\partial_{\bs x} \Phi^{(1)}_{D,R_j}(\bs x)=&\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{D,R_j}(\bs x)\bs{n}\delta_{\bs x \bs x'}-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{S_B} \partial_{\bs{x}} G(\bs x, \bs x') \sigma_{D,R_j}(\bs x') dS'
\end{align}
where the Kronecker delta $\delta_{\bs x \bs x'}=1 $ for $\bs x = \bs x'$, and $\delta_{\bs x \bs x'}=0$ otherwise.
\item The hydrodynamic coefficients are then computed as follows, the excitation force is defined as
\begin{align}
\bs F_{exc}^{(1)}&=\rho \iint_{S_{B}} -i\omega\left[  \Phi_I^{(1)}+ \Phi_D^{(1)}\right]\bs \nu dS.
\end{align}
The added mass matrix and damping coefficient matrix components are computed as
\begin{align}
M^a_{ij}= -\rho \iint_{S_{B}}  \nu_{i} Re \left\lbrace\psi_{R_j} \right\rbrace dS\\
B_{ij}= -\rho \omega \iint_{S_{B}} \nu_{i} Im \left\lbrace\psi_{R_j} \right\rbrace  dS.
\end{align}
\item  In post-processing, the radiation damping impulse response matrix function ($\bs{IRF}(t)$), the infinite frequency added mass matrix ($[\bs M^a](\infty)$), and the excitation force impulse response vector function ($\bs{IRF}_{ex}(t)$) are provided. They are computed as,
\begin{align*}
\bs{IRF}(t)&\approx\frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\omega_{max}}[\bs B](\omega)\cos(\omega t)d\omega, \\
[\bs M^a](\infty)&\approx  \frac{1}{N_{\omega}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\omega}}[\bs M^a](\omega_i)+\int_0^{t_{max}}\bs{IRF}(t)\sin(\omega_i t)dt\\
\bs{IRF}_{exc}(t)&\approx\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\omega_{max}}^{\omega_{max}}\bs F_{exc}(\omega)e^{-i\omega t}d\omega.
\end{align*}
where $\bs F_{exc}(-\omega)=\bs F^*_{exc}(\omega)$. Note that $\omega_{max}$ is a user-specified input, for better accuracy of $\bs{IRF}(t)$ make sure that $[\bs B ](\omega_{max})$ has reached an asymptotic value.
\item Response Amplitude Operators (RAO) are obtained by solving the following equation of motion
\begin{align}\label{Eq:RAO}
\left[-[\bs M+\bs M^a(\omega)]\omega^2-i\omega[\bs B(\omega)+\bs B_{add}]+[\bs K_h+\bs K_M]\right]\mathcal{\bs \xi}(\omega)=\bs F_{exc}(\omega)
\end{align}
where $[\bs B_{add}]$ and $[\bs K_M]$ are user-specified additional damping and stiffness matrices.
\end{itemize}
\ \\
NEMOH2, the second-order QTF module, is based on the following principles
\begin{itemize}
\item The second-order loads are composed of the quadratic part and the potential part, the detailed formulation is given in \cite{Kurnia22_JH,Kurnia22}.
\item The quadratic part is based on the near-field method \cite{CHEN88}.
\item The potential part is based on the
indirect method \cite{CHEN88,MOLIN79}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Numerical Methods}

NEMOH1 uses the following numerical approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item The BIE, Eq. \eqref{Eq:BIE_source_distribution}, is discretised using the constant panel method with quadrilateral mesh. This leads to a linear system with the influence coefficients matrix. The mesh is user-specified with the normal direction towards fluid.
\item Numerical implementation of the Green function is described in \cite{Babarit15}.
\item Free-surface Green function integrands are pre-calculated with the discretized $\omega^2r/g\in [0,100]$ with 676 points in a constant scale and $\omega^2(z+z')/g \in [-251,-1.6\, 10^{-6}]$ with 130 points in logarithmic scale. A polynomial surface interpolation with the $5^{th}$ order Lagrange formula is used for interpolating any values in the specified interval.

\item The specified points for the interpolation of the Green function are finer than in the previous release. However, an option to switch the two different tabulated Green function data is available in the source file \texttt{\textbackslash Solver\textbackslash Core\textbackslash INITIALIZE\_GREEN.f90} with the parameter FLAG\_IGREEN=1 or 2, 2 being the default.

\item Influence coefficients, the integration of $\partial_n G(\bs x, \bs x')$ over a body panel, is computed using  Gauss-quadrature integration with a user-input number of Gauss-quadrature points.

\item The source distributions on body panels are then obtained after solving the corresponding linear system.

\item The linear system is solved using a user-choice solver among the available ones, which are Gauss elimination, LU-decomposition (default) and GMRES-iterative solvers.

\item The GMRES solver code \cite{GMRES} from \href{https://www.cerfacs.fr/algor/Softs/GMRES/index.html}{\underline{CERFACS}} is embedded in NEMOH solver module. For using the GMRES solver, the user has to obtain a license in \url{https://www.cerfacs.fr/algor/Softs/GMRES/license.html}.

\item For free-surface piercing bodies problem, the irregular frequencies removal (IRR) method is applied by the user providing lid panels at $z=0$. Then, the extended boundary integral equation will be solved \cite{Babarit15,Malenica98}. As in \cite{Malenica98}, the IRR may be influenced by the input parameter $\epsilon$ in \texttt{input\_solver.txt} that shifts the lid panels from $z=0$ to $z=-\epsilon d_B$ where $d_B$ is a maximum horizontal distance of points on the body. $d_B$ is computed by the software.

\item RAO in Eq. \ref{Eq:RAO} is obtained by applying the inverse matrix using LU-decomposition.

\item The software can solve multi-bodies problems, as well as multi-directional waves.
\end{itemize}
\ \\ %newline after itemize
NEMOH2 uses the following numerical approach
\begin{itemize}
\item The QTF module can be run only after the first order-hydrodynamic coefficients are computed in NEMOH1.
\item In the potential part, the computation of the free-surface integral is an option:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For the difference-frequency QTFs, it is in general acceptable not to compute the free-surface integral terms.
    \item For the sum-frequency QTFs, it is necessary to compute the free-surface integrals.
\end{itemize}
\item Important notice: the computation with the free-surface integral still has an issue if the lid body panels exist (cf. IRR method). For now, the user is suggested not to specify the lid body panels in the mesh file input for NEMOH1 computation if he wants to compute the full QTFs with the free surface integral.
\item For the free-surface integral, a quadrilateral free-surface mesh has to be specified.
\item The computation can be done for bi-directional or uni-directional wave for the specified multiple wave direction.
\item QTF computations have not been tested yet for the multi-bodies problem.
\end{itemize}
\ \\
NEMOH related publications to be referred are  \cite{Babarit15} for the first order NEMOH and \cite{Philippe15,Kurnia22_JH,Kurnia22} for the QTF module. A publication related with this release is in preparation as in \cite{Kurnia23}.
\subsection{Units}
NEMOH expects all quantities to be expressed in S.I. units: $m, kg, s, rad$ (meter, kilogram, seconds, radian, respectively). But some of the phase outputs may be expressed in $deg$ or $^{\circ}$, in this case it will be indicated in the file header.

The force unit is [$N$], the moment unit is [$Nm$], added Mass [$kg$], damping coefficient [$kg/s$]. As the force output is normalized with the unit wave amplitude $a$ $[m]$, then the normalized force unit is [$N/m$] and the normalized moment is [$N$].

Response amplitude operator for translation motion has unit [$m/m$] and for rotation it is [$deg/m$].

The force quadratic transfer function (QTF) has unit [$N/m^2$] and for the moment QTF it is [$N/m$]. The QTF output is normalized by $\rho g$ where the fluid density $\rho,\ [kg/m^3],$ and the gravitation constant $g,\ [m/s^2]$.

\subsection{Software    features and capabilities}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6,trim = 0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm, clip]{figures/FlowChart.png}
\caption{Global flowchart of NEMOH software}\label{fig:flowchart}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:flowchart} shows a global overview of the software. There are three main programs: a mesh preprocessor, NEMOH1 and NEMOH2. The program features and capabilities are described as follows.

\subsubsection{Mesh Preprocessor}
NEMOH mesh preprocessor, the executable file \texttt{\textbf{mesh}}, is for generating the NEMOH mesh file with a given geometry input file and an input Mesh.Cal file. This \texttt{\textbf{mesh}} is not a meshing code but allows the user to refine an existing mesh and to calculate properties such as displacement, buoyancy center, and hydrostatic stiffness. It also makes estimates of masses and inertia matrix. The concept with this program is to write by hand a coarse description of the body under consideration in a GeomInput file and to have \texttt{\textbf{mesh}} make the refined mesh for NEMOH calculations.

\subsubsection{NEMOH1: 1st-order solver}
NEMOH1 solves the first-order potential flow problem. There are four modules: \texttt{\textbf{preProc}}, \texttt{\textbf{hydrosCal}}, \texttt{\textbf{solver}} and \texttt{\textbf{postProc}}, described as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\textbf{preProc}}: processes the input mesh file and generates the body condition for each calculation case (diffraction and radiation). The outputs are used as input for \texttt{\textbf{solver}}.
\item \texttt{\textbf{hydrosCal}}: computes hydrostatic parameters, i.e. stiffness matrix and inertia matrix. The output file will be used in the \texttt{\textbf{postProc}} for computing the RAOs. If the input mesh is generated by the NEMOH mesh preprocessor, \texttt{\textbf{mesh}}, the hydrostatic parameters are already computed and then it is not necessary to execute this program.
\item \texttt{\textbf{solver}}: solves the boundary value problems for each problem, diffraction and radiation, defined in the file \texttt{Normalvelocities.dat}, provided by the \texttt{\textbf{preProc}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item  The influence coefficients matrix is constructed with the infinite/finite depth Green function.
\item If a finite depth is specified, then the finite depth green function is applied only for $\frac{\omega^2}{g}D<20$, otherwise infinite depth case is applied.
\item The integration of the Green function on a panel for the influence coefficients is obtained by the Gauss-quadrature integration. The number of Gauss quadrature points is a user input.
\item The minimum distance, $\epsilon$, between the flow and source points for the influence coefficient computation is user-specified.
\item The source distributions are then obtained by solving the linear system. There are three options for the solver: Gauss elimination, LU-decomposition and GMRES.  If the GMRES solver \cite{GMRES} is used and the target tolerance is not achieved after the maximum number of iterations, the problem is automatically solved by LU-decomposition. License for using GMRES has to be obtained in \url{https://www.cerfacs.fr/algor/Softs/GMRES/license.html}.
\end{itemize}

\item \texttt{\textbf{postProc}}: post-processes the \texttt{\textbf{solver}}'s output files. The results are the excitation forces, added mass and damping coefficients. Optionally, the program computes
\begin{itemize}
\item the radiation damping impulse response function, the infinite frequency added mass and the excitation force impulse response function,
\item the Kochin coefficient,
\item the free-surface elevation,
\item the motion response amplitude operator (RAO). For the RAO computation, additional stiffness matrix $[\bs K_m]$ and additional damping $[\bs B_{add}]$ can be user-specified in the \texttt{Mechanics/} folder.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{NEMOH2: 2nd-order QTF module}
NEMOH2 computes the second-order wave loads that expressed in Quadratic Transfer Function (QTF). It is suggested to verify the first-order results before running the QTF module. There are three modules in this program: \textbf{QTFpreProc}, \textbf{QTFsolver} and \textbf{QTFpostProc}, described as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{QTFpreProc}: preparing the perturbed potential, the total potential, the normalized radiation potential and the corresponding velocities on the body panels, the water-line and the free-surface panels.
\
\begin{itemize}
\item The computation on free-surface panels requires longer computation time, so for the first-time it is suggested to compute without the Free-surface integral, HASFS, the option available in Nemoh.cal.
\item In general, the free-surface integral may be negligible for the difference-frequency QTFs computation.
\item The potential on waterline is rather sensitive with the $\epsilon$ value. For default, $\epsilon=0.001$, it can be adjusted in input\_solver.txt. The $\epsilon$ can be set different for NEMOH1 and NEMOH2. Further investigation about this is needed.
\item In case the body lid panels exist, the influence coefficients are affected  and give somewhat larger error for higher frequencies the free-surface potentials and velocities. This is also need to be investigated.
\item For now, in case of full-QTFs computation, user is suggested not specifying the lid body panels in a mesh file input for NEMOH1 computation.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{QTFsolver}: computing the quadratic part and the potential part of the second order loads. The free-surface integrals in the potential part QTF is an option to be computed.
\item \textbf{QTFpostProc}: summing all the computed QTF parts and produces the total QTF. Option to sum only some parts of QTF is available in Nemoh.cal.
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[scale=0.8,trim = 0mm 0mm 12mm 0mm, clip]{figures/NemohCal.png}
\caption{Nemoh.cal input file}\label{fig:NemohCal}
\end{figure}

\emph{Nemoh.cal} : contains all computation parameters with the format as, i.e in Fig. \ref{fig:NemohCal}. Following parameters have to be specified:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Environment}: fluid density, gravity constant, water-depth and wave reference point.  Specify $0.$ for infinite water depth case.
\item \emph{Description of floating bodies}: number of bodies, meshfile's name, number of points and number of panels, number of degrees of freedom, motion description, number of resulting generalized forces and its description.
\begin{itemize}
\item Meshfile has to be specified in the folder projdir/
\item Number of points and panels correspond with the data in the meshfile
\item For each motion and resulting generalized force, 7 parameters have to be specified in a row. First parameter, 1 for translation motion/force, 2 for rotation motion/force. Second to fourth parameters are unit vector of motion/force, 1 0 0 for surge/roll, 0 1 0 for sway/roll, 0 0 1 for heave/yaw. Fifth to seventh parameters are the reference point coordinate $(x,y,z)$.
\item In multibodies case, all the parameters have to be specified in rows for each body.
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{Load case to be solved}: contains wave frequency and wave direction parameter.
\begin{itemize}
\item Four wave frequency parameters have to be specified in a row. First, the frequency type, 1 for radial-frequency [rad/s], 2 for frequency [Hz] and 3 for period [s]. Second to fourth parameter are number of frequency, the minimum and maximum values.
\item In case of QTF is computed, it is suggested that the computed first-order hydrodynamic coefficients in NEMOH1 covers all difference-frequencies and sum-frequencies interval for the QTF computation. The suggested radial frequency interval is $\omega \in [\Delta \omega, \omega_{max}]$ with a step $\Delta \omega$,  $\omega_{max}=N_{\omega}\Delta \omega$ and $N_{\omega}$ is a total number of radial frequency. The $\omega_{max}$ should be choose as maximum computed sum-frequencies, $\omega_1+\omega_2$.
\item The wave direction parameters are number of direction, the minimum and maximum angle directions [deg].
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{Post processing} contain parameters for Impulse Response Functions, pressure, Kochin, free surface elevation, RAO and frequency type output.
\begin{itemize}
\item The IRFs computation requires 3 parameters; a switch 0 is not calculated, 1 calculated, a time-step and a maximum time.
\item A switch pressure parameter, 0 is not calculated, 1 calculated.
\item The Kochin parameters are a number of direction (specify 0 if it is not calculated), min and max values angle direction [deg].
\item The free surface parameters are number of point in x direction (specify 0 if it is not calculated) and y direction, dimension of domain in x and y direction [m].
\item A switch for RAO computation, 0 is not calculate and 1 calulated. If QTF will be computed, the RAO has to be computed then the switch has to be 1.
\item Frequency output option: 1 for the radial frequency [rad/s], 2 the frequency [Hz] and period [s].
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{Quadratic Transer Function (QTF)} contains following parameters
\begin{itemize}
\item A switch 1 is calculated and 0 is not calculated. If the switch=1 then the NEMOH1 module produces the source-distribution file for each problem and saved in /projdir/results/source.
\item The frequency parameters are only in radial frequency [rad/s], number of freq, min and max value. The values are not necessarily same as the input in NEMOH 1 but should be in the range as in NEMOH1 input, then an interpolation may be applied.
\item A directional switch is 0 for uni-direction and 1 for bi-direction. So in case of the multi-direction is applied in NEMOH1, all the direction interaction will be computed for the bi-direction case. In the uni-direction case, only the same-direction interaction, $\beta_1=\beta_2$, will be computed.
\item Contribution parameter: 1 computes only the quadratic terms of QTFs, DUOK, 2 computes the quadratic and the body force contribution in the potential QTFs, DUOK+HASBO, 3 the computation includes the free-surface integrals in the finite domain and semi-infinite domain, DUOK+HASBO+HASFS+ASYMP.
\item If Contrib=3, the a free-surface mesh file name has to be specified and the file is placed in /projdir/mesh. Type NA if it is not applicable, Contrib$<3$.
\item If Contrib=3, specify the free-surface parameters: an external radius, $R_e$ is the maximum radius as in the free-surface mesh, a number of discretized radius points in between the waterline $R_b$ and the external radius,  $[R_b,R_e]$, and number of bessel function. The number of bessel function is used in computation in the semi-infinite integral, specify 30 for  a default value.
\item Switch 1 for adding the quadratic QTF (DUOK) with the Hydrostatic terms of the quadratic  first order motion, $-[\bs K] \tilde{\bs \xi}^{(2)}$,where, with $z_G$ is the vertical component of CoG,
\begin{align*}
\tilde{\bs\xi}^{(2)}=[0,0,z_G(\theta_1^{(1)2}+\theta_2^{(1)2})/2,\theta_2^{(1)}\theta_3^{(1)}/2,-\theta_3^{(1)}\theta_1^{(1)}/2,0]^T.
\end{align*}
Note that this term is optional and need only in QTFsolver. In other software, i.e HYDROSTAR \cite{HYDROSTAR} this term is not included.
\item Frequency output option: 1 for the radial frequency [rad/s], 2 the frequency [Hz] and period [s].
\item In QTFpostproc, QTFs total is calculated with summation of all the terms. Option to exclude/include the terms are available with the corresponding switch for DUOK, HASBO and HASFS+ASYMP terms. Switch 1 to include, 0 to exclude. IF Contrib=2, then HASFS+ASYMP switch has to be 0.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\

\emph{Mesh file}: contains all the mesh information with a format as shown in Table \ref{tab:meshfile}. Lid panels ($z=0$) of the structure may be included in this file to switched-on the irregular frequencies removal method. This mesh file is may be generated by NEMOH's
\textbf{mesh} preprocessor or by a external mesh generator.
External mesh generators, i.e. the open-source software GMSH \cite{gmsh}, may be used with the generated mesh file must be adapted with the NEMOH format. A Matlab file for converting GMSH's mesh file to the NEMOH format is also provided in the repository. The Matlab file will be described in next section.

\emph{input\_solver.txt} contains solver parameters with format as in Table \ref{tab:input_solver}. The parameters are described as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item  Number of Gauss Quadrature points, $N^2$, is used for the surface integration in the influence coefficients. User specifies an integer value of $N\in [1,4]$, default $N=2$.
\item Minimum z of flow and source points is defined with a factor  eps\_zmin multiplied by the maximal horizontal distance between two point of the mesh, default eps\_zmin=0.001.
\item Three linear-system solvers are available; 1 Gauss elimination, 2 LU Decomposition, 3 GMRES iterative solver.
\item If GMRES solver is chosen then the three parameters, the restart parameter, relative tolerance and maximum iteration, have to be specified. If the tolerance is not achieved after the maximum iteration exceeded then LU decomposition solves the system directly.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output files}
\textit{Hydrostatic output files} such as inertia and stiffness matrices are produced by \textbf{mesh}, if \textit{geomInput} prescribed, or by \textbf{hydroCal}, if \textit{meshfile} prescribed. The files contain the matrix components with size $(Nbody\cdot Nradiation)\times (Nbody\cdot Nradiation)$.

Following hydrodynamics coefficients are produced in tecplot format, which can be open by the Tecplot program or by a text-editor program,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{FKForce.tec}, \textit{DiffractionForce.tec} and \textit{ExcitationForce.tec} are the output files of the Froude-Krylov, the diffraction and the excitation forces respectively. The output file format is given in Table \ref{tab:WaveForce}. The file contains the absolute value and the phase [deg] of the force for each frequency, $f$. The force is given for each specified force axis (i.e. surge, heave, pitch) for each body.  The frequency is given based on the chosen freq. type, [rad/s, Hz, s], of the post processing parameter in \textit{Nemoh.cal}, except the Froude-Krylov force is only in the radial frequency [rad/s].
\item \textit{RadiationCoefficients.tec} is the output file for added mass and damping coefficients with format as in Table \ref{tab:addedmass_damping_coeffs}. The radiation coefficients are given for each $DoF$, each force axis and for each frequency. The frequency is given based on the chosen freq. type, [rad/s, Hz, s], of the post processing parameter in \textit{Nemoh.cal}.
\end{itemize}
The hydrodynamic coefficients are also produced in the \textit{.dat} files, i.e. \textit{CA.dat} for the damping coefficients, \textit{CM.dat} for the added mass coefficients, \textit{Fe.dat} for the excitation force and \textit{FKForce.dat} for the excitation force. The frequency type of the output files is only radial frequency [rad/s]. This output files are used as input files for the QTF module.

\textit{RAO.dat} is the output file of the response amplitude operator with the file format as in Table. \ref{tab:RAO}. The output file gives the absolute value and the phase of RAO for each degree of freedom and each frequency. The frequency is given based on the chosen freq. type, [rad/s, Hz, s], of the post processing parameter in \textit{Nemoh.cal}. Only radial frequency output file will be produced in the case of the QTF computed.

\textit{IRF.tec} and \textit{IRF\_excForce.tec} are the impulse response functions for the radiation damping and the excitation force, respectively. The radiation damping IRF has the file format as in Table \ref{tab:IRF} and the excitation force IRF as in Table \ref{tab:IRFExcF}.

\textit{pressure.00XXX.dat}, \textit{kochin.00XXX.dat} and \textit{freesurface.00XXX.dat} are output files of pressure, kochin and free surface, respectively, for a specific problem-XXX. The problem number is defined as in order of the diffraction problem ($Nbeta$), the radiation problem ($Ndof$) and for each frequency. So problem-001 is the, first frequency and first wave direction, diffraction problem. Suppose $Nbeta=1$, then problem-002 is the first frequency radiation problem DoF 1. If $Ndof=6$ then problem-008 is the second frequency diffraction problem.

\textit{pressure.00XXX.dat} is a pressure output file for the problem-XXX.  In each file, the absolute value of pressure, $|P|$, (Pa) and the phase, $\angle P$, (rad) are given for each panel. The format of the output file is given in Table \ref{tab:pressure}.

\textit{kochin.00XXX.dat} is an output file of the kochin function on a prescribed direction for the problem-XXX. In each file, depends on diffraction/radiation problem, the computed absolute value of the Kochin, $|\mathcal{H}|$, and the phase, $\angle \mathcal{H}$, (rad) are saved for each direction,$\vartheta$. The format of the output file is given in Table \ref{tab:kochin}.

\textit{freesurface.00XXX.dat} is an output file of the free-surface elevation on a prescribed free-surface domain for the problem-XXX. In each file, depends on diffraction/radiation problem, the computed absolute value of the free-surface elevation, $|\eta|$, and the phase, $\angle \eta$, (rad) are saved for each free-surface panel position. The format of the output file is given in Table \ref{tab:freesurface}.

\textit{OUT\_QTFM\_N.dat} and \textit{OUT\_QTFP\_N.dat} are the output files of difference- and sum-frequencies QTF. The  QTF result are either the total QTF or parts of the QTF terms that depend on the user-choice QTF post-processing parameters in \textit{Nemoh.cal}. The QTF values are given in the absolute value with the phase in deg and real-imaginary parts. The QTF values are normalized by $\rho g$. The frequency type, [rad/s, Hz, s], depends on the user-choice in the $Nemoh.cal$. The format of the output file is given in Table \ref{tab:QTF}. Only the lower triangular part of the QTF matrix, is saved in the file. The full difference-frequency QTF matrix can be constructed with the lower triangular part of the matrix and the upper triangular part which is in conjugate-symmetric with the lower part. The upper triangular part of the sum-frequency QTF is symmetric with the lower triangular part.  A Matlab file for reading this output file is provided in /matlabRoutines/ and will be described in next section.

\section{Supporting Matlab files}\label{Sec:MatlabFiles}
Following Matlab files are provided in /matlabRoutines/,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nemoh Wrapper: This is for running NEMOH executables in MATLAB environment. \textbf{\color{red}The codes have not been updated yet for NEMOH v3.0 executables}.
    \item GMSHconverter: There are two codes, first, for converting body mesh file output from GMSH to NEMOH, DIODORE and HYDROSTAR formats and second, for converting free-surface mesh file output from GMSH to NEMOH and HYDROSTAR formats.
    \item postproc\_testcases: There are two main codes for plotting results from NEMOH and HYDROSTAR. First, for plotting hydrodynamic coefficients results and Second for plotting QTF results. This code can be executed after all data in the test-cases are obtained.
\end{itemize}


\section{Test-cases}\label{Sec:Testcase}
Following test-cases are provided for verification with Aquaplus software,
\begin{itemize}
\item 1\_Cylinder: half symmetric body mesh, deep water case, wave direction $0^{\circ}$. The results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Cylinder}.
\item 2\_2Bodies: half symmetric body mesh, two different bodies, water depth 20 m, wave direction $45^{\circ}$. The results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:2Bodies}.
\item 3\_Nonsymmetrical: full non-symmetrical body mesh, deep-water, wave direction $0^{\circ}$. Comparison of NEMOH results against Aquaplus are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:NonSymmetrical}, a slight difference are observed on the results.  Added mass and damping coefficients comparison between NEMOH and HYDROSTAR are shown in Fig \ref{fig:NonSymmetrical_massdamp} and for the excitation force is in Fig. \ref{fig:NonSymmetrical_excforce}. Good agremeent between NEMOH and HYDROSTAR is achieved.
\item 4\_Postprocessing: half symmetric body mesh, water depth 10 m, wave direction $0^{\circ}$. This test-case showing comparison of the free-surface elevation and the kochin function. The results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:PostProcessing}. The phase difference, $\pm \pi/2$, of wave elevation between NEMOH and AQUAPLUS is due to different convention of the incident potential.
\end{itemize}
Tecplot's layout file $.lay$ is provided in each test-cases folder for plotting in Tecplot.

Test-case 5\_QuickTest shows quantitative comparison of force and free-surface for the first-frequency diffraction problem. The comparison results are shown in the command window for all the test-cases inside the directory 5\_QuickTest.

Test-case 6\_box\_coarsemesh is showing procedure for running the code starting with the executable \textbf{mesh} with a coarse description mesh file, \textit{meshbox}. No reference data is given in this test case.

Test-case 7\_Solvers\_Check\_OC3 is showing performance of the three difference linear solvers, Gauss elimination, LU decomposition and GMRES. Reference logfiles reporting computation time of the solvers are provided.

The meshes of the next test-cases are obtained using GMSH \cite{gmsh} and shown in Fig. \ref{fig:meshesCylinderOC4} for the cylinder and OC4 platform and in Fig. \ref{fig:meshesSoftwindHYWIND} for the Softwind and OC3 HYWIND platforms.

Test-case 8a\_Cylinder\_irregfreq show results with and without irregular frequencies removal (IRR) method. The results are verified against HYDROSTAR with IRR and shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Cylinder_IRR_addedmass_dampcoef} for the added mass and damping coefficients and in Fig. \ref{fig:Cylinder_IRR_excforce} for the excitation forces.

\item 9\_QTF\_OC4\_Semisubmersible: full body mesh with lid panels, CoG $(0,0,0)$, water depth 200 m, wave direction $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, bi-directional QTF, the difference-frequency QTF DUOK+HASBO. The results are shown in the density plot, Fig. \ref{fig:QTFM_OC4} and in the off-diagonal line plot, Fig. \ref{fig:QTFM_diag_OC4}, of the bi-directional QTF $(\beta_1,\beta_2)=(0^{\circ},30^{\circ})$.
\item 10a\_QTF\_SOFTWIND: half symmetric body mesh with lid panels, CoG $(0,0,-71.56)$, water depth 200 m, wave direction $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, bi-directional QTF, the difference-frequency QTF DUOK+HASBO. The results are shown in the density plot, Fig. \ref{fig:QTFM_SOFTWIND} and in the off-diagonal line plot, Fig. \ref{fig:QTFM_diag_softwind}, of the bi-directional QTF $(\beta_1,\beta_2)=(0^{\circ},30^{\circ})$.

The results are shown in the density plot, Fig. \ref{fig:QTFP_SOFTWIND} and in the off-diagonal line plot, Fig. \ref{fig:QTFP_SOFTWIND_DIAG}.
\item 11\_QTF\_OC3\_Hywind: full body mesh with lid panels, CoG $(0,0,0)$, water depth 320 m, wave direction $0^{\circ}$, NEMOH1 uses GMRES solver, the difference-frequency QTF DUOK+HASBO. The results are shown in the density plot, Fig. \ref{fig:QTFM_OC3_HYWIND} and in the off-diagonal line plot, Fig. \ref{fig:QTFM_diag_OC3_HYWIND}, of the difference-frequency QTF.
\end{itemize}
Full description of the QTF test-cases results are reported in \cite{Kurnia22_JH}, \citep{Kurnia22}. Note that the QTF comparisons between NEMOH and HYDROSTAR for the bidirectional case are in good agreement only if the direction is switched, in NEMOH $\beta=(\beta_1,\beta_2)$ and in Hydrostar $\beta=(\beta_2,\beta_1)$; further investigation regarding this is needed. The imaginary part of QTFs have also difference sign between NEMOH and HYDROSTAR that may due to different convention of the incident potential.
